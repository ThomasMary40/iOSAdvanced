### What exactly does **Clean Code** mean ?

> Abstraction is evil. Code is anti-evil, and clean code is perhaps divine.

Instead of a vague definition, let's show it by Swift examples

## 1. Making your code readable is as important as making it executable

# Don't :

```swift
var i : Int // number of carrots in soup
var y : Int // number of fruits in my cart
```

# Do :

```swift
var numberOfCarrotsInSoup : Int
var numberOfFruitsInMyCart : Int
```

## 2. Functions should do one thing

## 3. Is comment my enemy ?

## 4. Format your code

## 5. Clean code must be robust

## 6. First make it work, then make it right


You should name your variables using the same care with which you name a first-born child.


Thank you for reading.

Leave the code a little cleaner than you found it before.
